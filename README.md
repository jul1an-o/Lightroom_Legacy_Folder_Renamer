# Lightroom Legacy Folder Renamer

This python script updates one of the legacy folder stuctures used in older versions of Lightroom Classic (5) which are no longer supported in current versions of Lightroom. The legacy organization structure follows this format:

`/year/month/year-month-day/.`

The updated folder structure reflects one of the current folder naming conventions supported as of Lightroom Classic (10):
`/year/month/day/.`
