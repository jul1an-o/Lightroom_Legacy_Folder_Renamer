# Lightroom Legacy Folder Renamer

This python script automates the renaming of legacy folder names (Lightroom Classic 5) to one of the currently supported (Lightroom Classic 10) folder naming conventions. The legacy organization structure follows this format:

`/year/month/year-month-day/.`

The updated folder structure reflects one of the current folder naming conventions supported as of Lightroom Classic 10:
`/year/month/day/.`
